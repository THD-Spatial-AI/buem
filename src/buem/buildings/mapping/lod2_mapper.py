"""
LOD2 + TABULA → Building mapper (orchestration).

Reads raw DataFrames from any ``BuildingSource`` (Excel or PostgreSQL) and
produces a list of canonical ``Building`` objects ready for v3 JSON generation.

This module orchestrates the mapping pipeline.  Domain-specific logic is
delegated to focused helper modules:

- **archetype_spec** — the per-archetype thermal description, resolved from
  either a TABULA row (residential) or the service-building reference
  table (non-residential)
- **element_factory** — window, door, ventilation element creation
- **tabula_helpers** — TABULA variant selection, window ratios, safe numerics
- **wall_classifier** — shared (party) wall detection

Both archetype sources produce the same ``ArchetypeSpec``, so everything
downstream of resolution — geometry, opening synthesis, element assembly —
is identical regardless of which one described the building. TABULA is a
residential typology, so without the second source every non-residential
building was skipped outright.

Table linkages
--------------
- ``lod2_building_feature.building_feature_id`` → ``lod2_child_feature_surface.building_feature_id``  (1:N)
- ``lod2_building_feature.tabula_variant_code_id`` → ``tabula.id``  (N:1)

Surface classification
----------------------
- ``objectclass_id = 709`` → WallSurface  (tilt always 90°; azimuth from DB, −1 → 0°)
- ``objectclass_id = 710`` → GroundSurface (tilt always 0°; azimuth always 0°)
- ``objectclass_id = 712`` → RoofSurface  (tilt: DB≥0 → as-is, DB<0 → 0°; azimuth always 0°)

Party-wall detection
--------------------
A wall is *shared* (party wall) when its ``surface_feature_id`` appears under
two or more ``building_feature_id`` values.  For shared walls:

- ``U = 0``  (adjacent heated space — no net heat transfer)
- ``b_transmission = 0``
- No windows, doors, or ventilation openings on shared walls

Front / back wall identification
--------------------------------
After filtering out party walls, the **front wall** is the exposed wall with the
largest area.  The **back wall** is the exposed wall whose azimuth is closest
to 180° opposite the front wall's azimuth (within a 90° tolerance; if no
candidate is close enough, there is no back wall).  See
:func:`~buem.buildings.mapping.element_factory.identify_front_back`.

Window / door / ventilation sizing
-----------------------------------
Window and door areas are **proportional** to actual LOD2 wall areas via TABULA
ratios.  Ventilation openings (1.0 m² front, 0.5 m² back) are capped at 10 %
of wall area and subtracted from the wall's opaque area.  See
:func:`~buem.buildings.mapping.element_factory.synthesize_openings` — this
same function (and the same documented rules) also drives the live
request-handling path when a caller doesn't supply its own window/door/
ventilation detail; see :mod:`buem.buildings.mapping.live_synthesis`.
